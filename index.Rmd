## About

The **European Social Survey** (ESS) is one of the largest and most significant research projects in the field of social sciences in Europe. It was initiated by the Expert Committee of the European Science Foundation.

The primary objective of the ESS is to monitor social changes occurring across Europe, including attitudes toward key societal issues, shifts in value systems, and behavioral trends.

The selection of topics addressed in the survey is determined by the General Assembly of the participating countries, in which Poland is also represented.
